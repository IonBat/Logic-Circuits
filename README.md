# Logic-Circuits
This is a study of logic circuits with feedback. The classic example is the cross coupled OR gates with inverter feedback. It is the circuit for SR flip Flop 

The folder SR Flip Flop contains the files Signals.pdf that is the full blown paper.  The file Siugnals.py is the python codes that genenerated the content of the paper in latex codes. The latex code generated is the file Signals.tex. The TexStudio opens the file Signals.tex and generate the Signals.pdf file.
